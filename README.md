This is the software to add a thumbnail for any video using GO.

WHY I am doing this ?
I been downloading videos from various sources...😉
But they fail to have a thumbnail

WHICH Model I will be using?
Suprisingly I thought of not use any AI model to pick a thumbnail.
insted to use a very old friend called FFMPEG

So this not first time I am trying to use FFMPEG , but first time to get a thumbnail selector

Isn't there any other Opensoruce option to it or any software which already dose this ?
May be ? I don't know, and I don't want to use any other this time.
